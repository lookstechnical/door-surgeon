      - heading: Glass Replacement and Repair
        description: Expert UPVC window glass replacement addresses cracks, chips, or
          complete breakage, ensuring clear visibility and improved thermal
          performance. Regular maintenance and prompt repair of damaged glass
          help maintain a secure and energy-efficient home
      - heading: Seal and Gasket Replacement
        description: Over time, UPVC window seals and gaskets may deteriorate, leading
          to drafts and water leakage. Replacing these critical components
          restores weatherproofing, prevents moisture intrusion, and improves
          insulation—key aspects for energy-efficient UPVC window repair.
      - heading: Hardware Repairs and Upgrades
        description: Damaged or worn hardware, such as hinges, locks, and handles, can
          compromise window security and functionality. Professional repair or
          replacement of these elements not only enhances the safety of your
          UPVC windows but also improves their ease of use.
      - heading: Frame and Sash Repairs
        description: UPVC window frames and sashes may warp or suffer from wear due to
          environmental factors. Repairing or reinforcing these structures
          ensures smooth operation and extends the overall lifespan of the
          windows while maintaining their aesthetic appeal.
      - heading: Track and Balance System Maintenance
        description: For UPVC windows with sliding or tilt-and-turn mechanisms, ensuring
          that tracks are clean and balance systems are functioning properly is
          essential. Regular track cleaning, lubrication, and balance
          adjustments prevent sticking and enable effortless operation.
      - heading: Caulking and Insulation Repairs
        description: Deteriorated caulking around UPVC windows can lead to energy loss
          and water ingress. Reapplying high-quality caulking restores
          insulation, enhances energy efficiency, and prevents costly interior
          damage over time.
