    desc: If your window looks steamed up or misted it may be time to get a new
      double-glazing unit. This can be caused from condensation between
      the         two panes of glass where the double-glazed unit has broken
      down or         failed. This will only get worse over time, it can also
      stop the light         from entering the room and is also no longer energy
      efficient, so the         heat will leak out of your home costing you
      money.
